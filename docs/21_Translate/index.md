Like Drupal, DrupalGap is built with English as the default language and provides multi lingual support. Here's a simple
example using DrupalGap's `dg.t()` function:

```
var msg = dg.t('Hello');
dg.alert(msg);
```

By default, the word **Hello** would be displayed. We can easily set up additional languages to be used, so DrupalGap
will say **Hello** in the appropriate language.
